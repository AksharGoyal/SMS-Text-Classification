# SMS-Text-Classification
## Used Machine Learning and Neural Networking to create a model that classifies a message as spam or ham.

As part of freeCodeCamp's Machine Learning with Python curriculum, I had to work on the project "Neural Network SMS Text Classifier" where I used my knowledge of Machine Learning and Neural Network to create a simple RNN model that classifies a text message as ham(not spam) or spam.

While I like to work on tabular data where data is a mix of numerical and categorical data, I really enjoyed stepping out of my comfort zone and realizing that working with text-based data can be fun too because in the end, data is data! It is fun to play with and get your hands dirty in.

Take your time to explore my notebook and enjoy learning ðŸ˜Š
